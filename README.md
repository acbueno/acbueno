👋 Hi, I'm Anderson Bueno.

👀 I'm passionate about software architecture, microservices, and scalability, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas. Currently, I'm diving deep into the principles of hexagonal architecture, exploring how it can be applied to create robust and maintainable software systems.

🌱I have extensive experience working with Java and Spring Boot, building scalable and efficient applications. Recently, I've been exploring Quarkus as a framework for building Java applications optimized for performance and resource utilization in cloud-native environments.

💞️ I'm also interested in event-driven architectures and have practical experience with message brokers like RabbitMQ and Kafka, leveraging them to build resilient and decoupled systems.

📫  I'm always open to collaborating on projects that challenge me to think innovatively and push the boundaries of what's possible in software development. Feel free to reach out to me via email at anderson.carlosb@gmail.com to discuss potential opportunities or just to connect!
